    <string name="about_content">Fun and competitive incentive platform to promote biking on the University of Illinois campus.
        Users will be able to access a web dashboard that shows riding history and milestones achieved.
        The platform would support competitive leaderboards for campus groups (such as among departments or RSOs) to recognize the top bikers and groups.
        Administrative users have a platform with congestion analytics for insights into making infrastructure updates to promote bike usage and safety.</string>
